## Introduction
This is a small project that crawled about 700 book covers in Data & AI fields in Amazon.

## Agenda
1. I used pandas to load redefined csv file, handled, and converted to list;
2. For each handled title in that list, I used Google Search API to crawling original image (full size, not thumnail);
3. Finally, write the image to *.jpg file.
